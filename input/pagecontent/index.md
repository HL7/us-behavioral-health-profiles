### US Behavioral Health Profiles

## Introduction 

The USCDI+ Behavioral Health (BH) dataset aims to enhance the exchange and interoperability of behavioral health information across healthcare systems in the United States. Building on the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) foundation, this dataset addresses the unique needs and challenges associated with behavioral health data. It is designed to facilitate the integration of behavioral health with other healthcare services, support better clinical decision-making, and improve patient outcomes.

## Background 

Behavioral health, encompassing mental health and substance use disorders, is a critical component of overall health and well-being. The increasing prevalence of these disorders necessitates robust information technology (IT) systems to support efficient and effective care. However, the fragmentation of behavioral health information has historically hindered the ability of healthcare providers to deliver comprehensive, coordinated care. In addition, behavioral health providers often lag in adopting health IT due to factors like ineligibility for incentive programs and the complexity of documenting behavioral health encounters. These factors and others complicate the sharing of behavioral health data impeding care coordination and integration of behavioral health with other health settings. 

The USCDI+ BH dataset seeks to address this fragmentation by establishing, harmonizing, and advancing a core list of standardized interoperable data elements to capture treatment data for adults with mental health and substance use disorders. This effort supports the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Substance Use and Mental Health Block Grants reporting requirements for funding, reporting, monitoring outcomes, and developing performance measures. The dataset development involved collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders, including behavioral health clinicians, patient advocacy groups, healthcare IT developers, and policymakers. This collaborative approach aimed to address the needs and priorities of all stakeholders while aligning with existing standards and regulations. 

## Audience
This Implementation Guide (IG) is intended for a technical audience working with behavioral health data, including EHR vendors and developers of software tooling who need to understand how to structure behavioral health data using the USCDI+ standard for interoperability. Researchers, business analysts, and policy managers can also benefit from a basic understanding of how this guide supports measure calculation for informed decision-making in research and policy development.  

Standardizing behavioral health data through this IG aims to improve data exchange and interoperability in the behavioral health ecosystem, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and outcomes.
