### US Behavioral Health Profiles

## Introduction 

The USCDI+ Behavioral Health (BH) dataset aims to enhance the exchange and interoperability of behavioral health information across healthcare systems in the United States. Building on the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) foundation, this dataset addresses the unique needs and challenges associated with behavioral health data. The USCDI+ BH dataset is designed to facilitate behavioral health integration with other healthcare services, support better clinical decision-making, and improve patient outcomes. 

## Background 

Behavioral health, encompassing mental health and substance use disorders, is a critical component of overall health and well-being. However, the fragmentation of behavioral health information has historically hindered the ability of healthcare providers to deliver comprehensive, coordinated care. The USCDI+ BH dataset seeks to address this fragmentation by establishing, harmonizing, and advancing a core list of standardized, interoperable data elements that can be used to capture treatment data for adults with mental health and substance use disorders. This effort also supports the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Substance Use and Mental Health Block Grants reporting requirements for funding, reporting, monitoring outcomes, and developing performance measures. 

The development of the USCDI+ BH dataset involved collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders, including behavioral health clinicians, patient advocacy groups, healthcare IT developers, and policymakers. This collaborative approach sought to address the needs and priorities of all stakeholders while aligning with existing standards and regulations. Standardizing the behavioral health dataset will enhance the accuracy, completeness, availability, and interoperability of mental health and substance use data within Electronic Health Records (EHRs), contributing to improved patient and client care and outcomes. 

## Audience
