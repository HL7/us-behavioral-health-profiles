### Scope and Usage 

The USCDI+ Behavioral Health (BH) initiative is designed to facilitate the seamless integration and exchange of behavioral health data across various healthcare settings. By harmonizing and advancing a core list of standardized interoperable data elements, the initiative aims to capture comprehensive treatment data for adults with mental health and substance use disorders. This effort is aligned with the reporting requirements of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for Substance Use and Mental Health Block Grants, thus supporting funding, reporting, monitoring outcomes, and developing performance measures.
