### +BH to FHIR Profile

This table serves as a crosswalk between USCDI+ behavioral health data elements and their corresponding proposed FHIR profiles. The table maps the +BH data classes and elements, such as adverse events, allergies, clinical notes, and patient demographics, to FHIR profiles, showing how each USCDI+ BH element aligns with FHIR's data standards. This alignment facilitates the standardized exchange of health information across different systems, ensuring consistency and interoperability in managing and sharing healthcare data.
