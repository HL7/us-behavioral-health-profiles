# Summarized Story of James 
Six months ago, James Wolff, a 60-year-old African American male assigned female at birth, visited the emergency department (ED) due to chest pain, sweating, and a racing heart. Diagnosed with a panic attack likely triggered by grief over his partner's recent death, James's medical history includes type 2 diabetes, moderate depression, and past substance abuse. At the ED, he received an anti-anxiety medication and a referral to a community mental health provider. His health challenges were compounded by social isolation, financial strain, and difficulty managing his diabetes and depression without his partner's support. 

Upon visiting the community mental health provider, James engaged in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and joined a grief support group. His case manager connected him with community services, including meal delivery and bus vouchers, and helped him apply for disability benefits. Despite initial setbacks like missing CBT sessions due to transportation issues, James gradually improved his diabetes management and reduced his alcohol intake. James reported feeling better and more connected by attending virtual CBT sessions and exploring social activities like Zumba and line dancing. His care team adjusted his medication to minimize side effects and continued to support his mental health and social needs, significantly improving his overall well-being.
