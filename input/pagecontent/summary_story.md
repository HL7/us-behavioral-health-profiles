### Summary 

Six months ago, James Wolff, a 60-year-old African American male assigned female at birth, visited the emergency department (ED) due to chest pain, sweating, and a racing heart. He was diagnosed with a panic attack, likely triggered by grief over his partner's recent death. James has a medical history of type 2 diabetes, moderate depression, and past substance use. At the ED, he was prescribed anti-anxiety medication and referred to a community mental health provider. His challenges included social isolation, financial strain, and difficulty managing his diabetes and depression without his partner's support and limited family support. 

James began engaging in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and joined a grief support group after visiting the community mental health provider. His care manager connected him with essential community services such as meal delivery and transportation assistance and helped him apply for disability benefits. Initially, James faced setbacks, including missing CBT sessions due to transportation issues, but he gradually improved his diabetes management and reduced his alcohol intake. 

Despite some progress, James experienced increased fatigue, dizziness, and nausea, leading him to discontinue his antidepressant medication. He also suffered a fall at home, resulting in a minor knee injury. His care team responded by adjusting his treatment plan, providing education on alcohol use, and resuming antidepressants with a different prescription to mitigate side effects. Additionally, they connected James with social activities like community line dancing to combat his isolation. Over time, James's overall well-being improved significantly as he remained committed to his care plan, attended virtual CBT sessions consistently, and engaged more in social activities.
